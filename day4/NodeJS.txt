Here we are going to install NodeJS.

What is NodeJS?
    It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers,
    such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was originally designed with real-time,
    push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.
